# RESTful API for Fasv APP (Exercise)

## Description:

Favs is a new company that aims to provide a better way to organize your favorite things: music, clothes, courses, etc., all in one place.

The CEO of Favs hired you to develop the initial version of his product. Itâ€™s worth mentioning that she does not have any technical background.

However, she has a clear vision on how the product should behave, so she provided a list of functional requirements.

## What is needed:

*A well-designed solution and architecture: Avoid duplication, extract re-usable code where makes sense. We want to see that you can create an easy-to-maintain codebase.
*Storage: We need a MongoDB database implementation.
*Testing: Try to create tests covering the main functionalities of your code. Feel free to create both unit tests and functional tests.
*Documentation: The CEO has a non-tech background so try to explain your decisions, as well as any other technical requirement (how to run the API, external dependencies, etc...)

## Technology and libraries implemented:

MongoDB and Mongoose, Node.js, Express, JWT, Unit Tests with Jest and SuperTest, JOI, Swagger.
